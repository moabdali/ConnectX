ConnectX allows you to play connect 4 but with a custom board size.


v 0.1 - has a working GUI
	Alternates turns each time a piece is set
	Currently drops piece exactly where you click
	Correctly makes sure you can't place in an occupied location
	Does NOT have gravity yet
	Does NOT have a win condition programmed yet
	
	To do: 
		add a win condition (possibly allow player to determine the length of a win)
		add logic for the win condition
		add gravity
		consider adding a tic tac toe option as well since they're similar and the game
			currently is more well suited to tic tac toe than connect 4 anyway
		consider allowing player to choose their image
		add a minimum and max size for the game
		consider non-square game grid (i.e. 10x20 instead of only 10x10 or 20x20)
		animations for falling pieces after gravity is set
